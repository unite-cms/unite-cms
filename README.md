#### Releasing versions

Because the code splitter we are using at the moment is only listening to code push and not to tag push, you need to 
modify files in every bundle that needs to get updated. There is a command that does this for you. Just change the 
version in src/Bundle/UniteCmsCoreBundle.php and execute to update all VERSION.md files:

    bin/console unite:versionfile:dump

After that you can add a new git tag version and push the new 
tag to the repository:

    git commit -m "Release version 0.X.X"
    git tag -a v0.X.X -m ""
    git push origin --tags
    git push origin master
